def eureka_badmask(meta, data, uncd, sigma=None):

  """
    This function generates a bad pixel mask from Spitzer time-series
    photometry data.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    data:    ndarray
             array of shape (maxnimpos,ny,nx,npos) , where nx and ny
             are the image dimensions, maxnimpos is the maximum number
             of images in the largest set, and npos is the number of
             sets (or 'positions').
    uncd:    ndarray 
             Uncertainties of data.
    pmask:   ndarray
             The permanent bad pixel mask for the instrument.
    pcrit:   scalar
             A bitmask indicating which bits in Pmask are critical
             problems for which we should flag a bad pixel.
    dmask:   The per-frame bad pixel masks for the dataset.  Same
		shape as Data, maybe different type.
    dcrit:
    fp:      2D ndarray
             Per-frame parameters, of shape (npos, maxnimpos)
    nimpos:  1D ndarray
             zero-based index of the last valid image in each position
             of data.
    sigma:  1D ndarray
            Successive sigma-rejection threshholds, passed to sigrej.
            If not defined, the data check is skipped, so that another
            routine can be used for that step.  Still allocates the
            array and initializes it with pre-flagged bad pixels (NaNs
            and prior masks).

    Return:
    -------
    ndarray
    This function returns a byte array, with the same shape as data,
    where 1 indicates the corresponding pixel in Data is good and 0
    indicates it is bad.

    2005-10-13 jh        Restructured and largely rewritten.  Header added.
    2005-10-26 jh        Renamed rejct to nsigrej, updated comments.
    2005-11-21 jh        Added SIGMA keyword instead of hard-coding it.
    2005-11-24 jh        Changed badmask to mask, mask to smask, added nsstrej.
    2005-11-25 jh        Changed to use FP.
    2007-05-29 khorning  Handle data with only 3 dimensions
    2007-06-28 jh        Cleaned up indentation.
    2008-05-08 kevin     Added uncertainty array 'uncd', applied NaN test.
